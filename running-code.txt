For building the modified version of MIRAI
cargo install --locked --path ./checker


You have to set up your call graph config file first there are instructions for that in the mirai docs but I can send you mine if you want
export MIRAI_FLAGS="--call_graph_config <path/to/config/json>"
run cargo clean or interact with the main file in some way
then run cargo mirai
